== TODO

* Build image myself with modifications.
** https://github.com/sipeed/NanoKVM/issues/115[] -> https://github.com/scpcom/LicheeSG-Nano-Build/tree/develop
** Lower Kernel allocated memory from 128MB to 96MB or 64 MB
*** https://github.com/sipeed/NanoKVM/issues/66[]
 -- Mentioned here that 128MB are allocated, which implies that 256MB are available on the device in total?
    Also mentioned in Tailscale OOM kill thread.

=== Updating Tailscale

NOTE: `nanokvm` is an alias which I configured in my `ssh_config`. You need to use whatever you have configured or the default values.

https://asciinema.org/a/wX8bY1rd6HKvzDfdWPtZQkveW[asciinema_2024-12-06_103007_nanokvm_tailscale_update.cast]

[IMPORTANT]
====
It looks like version number 1.70 and others have been hard coded into the image or app at compile time instead of fetching the latest program version.

* https://github.com/sipeed/NanoKVM/blob/main/server/service/network/tailscale.go#L71
====

[source,bash]
----
ssh nanokvm

# Enables auto-update for future updates.
tailscale set --auto-update

# Do the update now and check that updates can be executed.
tailscale --version
tailscale update
tailscale --version

# Restart the service.
/etc/init.d/S98tailscaled restart

== Security

* EMBA scan https://github.com/lwbt/emba_20240809_NanoKVM_Rev1_2_0.img
* The application runs as root user, don't expect a lot of security conscious design here for now.
  I may be wrong, but I think OpenWrt and similar appliances are quite similar when it comes to
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege[PoLP].
  I should check.
* The web interface warns you about the default password being unsafe and wants you to change it.
  SSH access is the same, but there is no notification at all.
** The product should not be shipped with trivial default passwords.
** Both ways to access the product should be clearly and easily documented while using the primary way to use the product through the web interface.
** Many users will have no idea that SSH is also running with a trivial password exploitable by malware.
** The SSH service should be deactivated by default.
   The service should be configurable through the web interface.
   At worst a user can still mount the SD card with the operating system on another computer to troubleshoot access issues or reinstall the operating system.
   Many home routers have a safer out of the box experience while not having this luxury.
** Tailscale SSH would be a great way for secure SSH access.

User authentication is done by your identity provider, which prevents entire classes of attacks.

Huge potential, not well executed, barley scratching at the surface of what could be possible and should be done responsibly today.
Sorry for the strong wording, but such malpratices should not be downplayed when attacks threaten to disrupt essential services and such products can easily become part of bot nets.
