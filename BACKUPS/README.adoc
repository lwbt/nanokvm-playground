== TODO

[NOTE]
====
This is just a small utility as a makefile with some assumptions.
These assumptions may be wrong, just get stuff done before diving deeper into (over) engineering shell scripts, scripts or entre programs.
One assumption is that you are running a recent GNU Linux Shell with make.
If you are not, then you are not "my audience" and I don´t have time to fulfill all your needs.

.Implement backup and restore script for OS image updates
* [ ] There shouldn't be much to back up, most settings of the app seem to be stored in browser session state or cookies.
* [ ] Script and sync `admin` and `root` password. (Hashed in the respective files.)
* [ ] Implement a restore function.
* [ ] Compare `images` and `backup-YYYY-MM-DD` (today) and offer to interactively delete files not referenced in `backup-YYYY-MM-DD`. (Utilize `gum`.)
* [x] Script to transfer and restore SSH authorized keys. (You need to have the public key on your machine in your authorized keys. I prefer to keep it simple. If this is a concern for you, then you have to roll your own.)
* [x] Do not extract Tailscale status, onboard it as new device and replace the old.
* [x] List content on the `/data` volume with `tree`.
* [x] `rsync` contents. Store all images in an `images` folder, link them to a `backup-YYYY-MM-DD` (`date -I`) folder.

== Rsync backup of images

.What does the result look like?

3 directories, 6 files
----

The `images` folder is intended to serve as a cache to be cleaned up over time or used as a full archive of images.
The `--delete` option is deliberately not used to keep previous backup intact.

[NOTE]
====
Another option in the makefile may be introduced in the future to clean up a
directory, but there might be a better interactive solution utilizing `gum` and
comparing the sender and receiver side.

Q: How can I use rsync to treat existing symlinks on the destination as files and skip copying these files when they match the source state?

---

A:

.Options:
* `-av --copy-links --ignore-existing` -- This works, suggested by ChatGPT.
* `--keep-dirlinks` with `--munge-links` -- Might work
* `--copy-unsafe-links` -- Does not work.
* `--link-dest=$DEST` -- Does not work.
* `--safe-links` -- Does not work.
* SYMBOLIC LINKS section -- Implied that such a behavior might not be supported.
