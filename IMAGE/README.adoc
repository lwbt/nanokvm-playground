== Info

Since I wasn't sure if FFmpeg is used at all I wanted to create an entire new image and see how it performs.
It tunred out that the official image in version 1.3 had been released 2 weeks ago, which increased the amount of available RAm, but it was not recgnized by the updater.
On the ohter hand I realized I could make the scripts build FFmpeg version 5 instead of 4, but the resulting image would still have version 4.
So we are at a wild mix of different things.
The official image has the latest app and fixes.
The updated image has most security patches.
FFmpeg can be built in version 7 as a static binary with GCC.

TODO: Try to build FFmpeg with musl.

== Building the image

* Compiling the toolchain takes about 2 hours and is not worth it when it can be fetched and unpacked inh less the n1 minute.
* Image can be compled on my workstation in less than 30 minutes.
* As mentioned above, the extra effort to compile a newer version of FFmpeg is not worth it, since it gets replaced by some yet unkown mechanism.
